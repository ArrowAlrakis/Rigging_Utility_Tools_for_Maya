# Main Shelf Script
ðŸ“„ [shelf_Pyt_Tools_v01.mel](./shelf_Pyt_Tools_v01.mel) â€“ Main shelf


# Python Scripts

ðŸ“„ [Python_Tools_Utilities_v01.py](./Scripts/Python_Tools_Utilities_v01.py) â€“ Contains the functions for the first 8 buttons on the shelf, including modules: 
1. Object Snap.
2. Show/Hide Local Axis.
3. Add current project path to Maya python path.
4. Combine many object shapes into one.
5. Lock/Unlock Attributes UI.
6. Create Ball control UI.
7. Create Pole control UI.
8. Create Label UI.

ðŸ“„ [RebuildJointChain_v01.py](./Scripts/RebuildJointChain_v01.py) â€“ Rebuilds selected joint chains with adjustable resolution using motion paths.

ðŸ“„ [DoControl_v01.py](./Scripts/DoControl_v01.py) â€“ Generates custom control curves and assigns them to selected objects.

ðŸ“„ [SeedPlanter_v02.py](./Scripts/SeedPlanter_v02.py) â€“ Scatters seed objects randomly on a selected surface, now includes a rearrange() feature and Outliner group organization.

ðŸ“„ [HeightPreview_v01.py](./Scripts/HeightPreview_v01.py) â€“ Creates preview bars to visualize object heights in world space.

ðŸ“„ [RebuildJointChain_v01.py](./Scripts/RebuildJointChain_v01.py) â€“ Rebuilds selected joint chains with adjustable resolution using motion paths.

# Overview

This shelf contains 13 buttons covering: Control creation and assignment; Randomized object scattering (Seed Planter); Joint rebuilding from hierarchy; Fast Height texture visual feedback; Quick concept generation; Utility functions for selection, naming, grouping, snapping, pivot control, attribute control, etc.

Most tools are accessible through simple Maya UI popups or one-click shelf actions. Scripts are written in Python using maya.cmds and tested in Maya 2020â€“2025.

# How to Use
Option 1
1. Open Maya
2. Drag and drop or execute `shelf_Pyt_Tools_v01.mel` in the Script Editor
3. This will install the custom shelf Pyt_Tools with 13 buttons, all connected to the Python scripts.
4. Click any button to run its associated tool.


Option 2
1. Open Maya
2. Load any `.py` script from this repo into the Script Editor (Python tab)
3. Execute it to run the tool or open its UI
4. Some scripts (`Python_Tools_Utilities_v01.py`) contain multiple utility functions. You may need to run specific function calls manually, for example:

    import Python_Tools_Utilities_v01 as utils
   
    utils.rename_objects()
